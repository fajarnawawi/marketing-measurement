## 📚 Appendix: Quick Reference

### **Key Marketing Metrics**
```python
CTR = clicks / impressions
CVR = conversions / clicks
CPA = cost / conversions
ROAS = revenue / cost
CPC = cost / clicks
CPM = (cost / impressions) * 1000
LTV = avg_order_value * purchase_frequency * customer_lifespan
```

### **Essential Libraries**
```python
import pandas as pd              # Data manipulation
import numpy as np              # Numerical operations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Visualization
import seaborn as sns          # Statistical plots
from scipy import stats        # Statistical tests
import statsmodels.api as sm   # Regression models
```

### **Common Patterns**
```python
# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('campaigns.csv')

# Calculate metrics
df['roas'] = df['revenue'] / df['cost']

# Filter
high_performers = df[df['roas'] >= 3.0]

# Group by
channel_summary = df.groupby('channel')['revenue'].sum()

# Plot
df.plot(x='date', y='conversions', kind='line')
```
