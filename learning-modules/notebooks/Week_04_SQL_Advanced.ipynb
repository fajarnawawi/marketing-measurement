    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Master advanced SQL techniques for complex marketing measurement and attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Commitment:** ~1 hour per day × 7 days = 7 hours total\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Learn:**\n",
    "- Advanced window functions (LAG, LEAD, NTILE, PERCENT_RANK)\n",
    "- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readable queries\n",
    "- Temporary tables and query optimization\n",
    "- Date/time operations for cohort analysis\n",
    "- String manipulation for campaign parsing\n",
    "- Advanced joins and set operations\n",
    "- Complex marketing analytics queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "As a Marketing Measurement Partner, you'll tackle complex questions:\n",
    "- Which campaigns drove the highest customer lifetime value?\n",
    "- How do customers behave across their first 90 days?\n",
    "- What's the optimal budget distribution across channels?\n",
    "- How has campaign efficiency trended month-over-month?\n",
    "- Which touchpoints contribute most to conversions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced SQL lets you answer these questions efficiently and elegantly.\n",
