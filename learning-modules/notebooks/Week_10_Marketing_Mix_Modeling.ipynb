    "\n",

    "Sales = β₀ + β₁×TV + β₂×Digital + β₃×Radio + β₄×Print + β₅×Seasonality + ε\n",
    "```\n",

    "- **Sales**: Target variable (conversions, revenue, units sold)\n",
    "- **β coefficients**: Impact of each marketing channel\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: Control variables (holidays, trends, etc.)\n",
    "- **ε**: Random error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Uses **aggregate data** (weekly/daily totals, not user-level)\n",
    "- Measures **incremental impact** of marketing\n",
    "- Accounts for **delayed effects** (adstock)\n",
    "- Models **diminishing returns** (saturation)\n",
    "- Requires **historical data** (typically 2+ years of weekly data)"
